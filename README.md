## TODO:
- PRIORITY: Complete all pages via importing Contentful content and organizing it in the React DOM.
- STYLE: Consider stylistic appeal; consult with shop owner for marketing aesthetic.
- PAGES: Statically generated pages (home) and dynamic/rendered pages (individual artist pages and "available designs" page).
- TESTING: Conduct a unit testing protocol for "functional"/responsive components using Jest. Brainstorm E2E testing procedure with Cypress.

- COMPLETED: Connect Contentful CMS to project via GraphQL. Render components on frontend via content delivered through Contentful. Initialize and populate Next SEO Head Component.

## Overview
This is the repository for Rare Breed Ink's website. I am tasked with creating a site that can functionally deliver a more streamlined user experience (than the current Squarespace model), while optimizing load times and the overall Google Lighthouse score. Currently, it is still in development. Expected release within October (just in time for Halloween)!

## Technologies
Frontend: NextJS + Typescript
Backend: Contentful (CMS) + GraphQL (APIs)
QA Engineering: Cypress (E2E) + Jest (unit testing)
DevOps Protocol: GitLab CI/CD and Vercel
